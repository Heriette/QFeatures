`QFeatures` is a [Bioconductor
package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/QFeatures) that provides
infrastructure enabling the management and processing of quantitative
features for high-throughput mass spectrometry assays. It provides a
familiar Bioconductor user experience to manages quantitative data
across different assay levels (such as peptide spectrum matches,
peptides and proteins) in a coherent and tractable format.

The `QFeatures` class is used to manage and process quantitative
features for high-throughput mass spectrometry assays. See the
[QFeatures
introduction](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/articles/QFeatures.html)
to get started and the [Processing quantitative proteomics data with
QFeatures](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/articles/Processing.html)
vignette for a real-life application.
