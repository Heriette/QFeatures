\arguments{
\item{x}{An instance of class \link{Features}.}

\item{y}{A \code{character} of feature names present in an assay in \code{x}.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters. Ignored.}
}
\value{
An new instance of class \link{Features} containing relevant
assays and features.
}
\description{
This function will find the assays and features that match
directly (by name) or indirectly (through aggregation) the feature
name.

The \code{subsetByFeature} function will first identify the assay that
contains the feature(s) \code{i} and filter the rows matching these
feature names exactly. It will then find, in the other assays, the
features that produces \code{i} through aggregation with the
\code{aggregateFeatures} function.

See \link{Features} for an example.
