# Introduction

## Reading data as `Features`

We are going to use a subset of the CPTAC study 6 containing
conditions A and B. The peptide-level data, as processed by MaxQuant
is available in the `msdata` package:


```{r msdata}
basename(f <- msdata::quant(pattern = "cptac", full.names = TRUE))
```

From the names of the columns, we see that the quantitative coumns,
starting with `"Intensity."` (note the space!) are at positions 56 to
61.

```{r cptac_cols}
names(read.delim(f))
(i <- grep("Intensity\\.", names(read.delim(f))))
```

We now read these data using the `readFeatures` function. The peptide
level expression data will be imported into R as an instance of class
`Features` namesd `cptac` with an assay named `peptides`. We also use
the `fnames` argument to set the rownames of the `peptides` assay to
the peptide sequences.

```{r read_cptac}
library("Features")
cptac <- readFeatures(f, ecol = i, sep = "\t", name = "peptides", fnames = "Sequence")
```

## Encoding the experimental design

Below we update the sample (column) annotations to encode the two
groups, 6A and 6B, and the original sample numbers.

```{r}
cptac$group <- rep(c("6A", "6B"), each = 3)
cptac$sample <- rep(7:9, 2)
colData(cptac)
```

## Filtering out contaminants and reverse hits


```{r}
filterFeatures(cptac, ~ Reverse == "")
```
```{r}
filterFeatures(cptac, ~ Potential.contaminant == "")
```

```{r}
library("magrittr")
cptac <- cptac %>%
    filterFeatures(~ Reverse == "") %>%
    filterFeatures(~ Potential.contaminant == "")
```

## Removinf up unneeded feature variables

The spreadsheet that was read above contained numerous variables that
are returned by MaxQuant, but not necessarily necessary in the frame
of a downstream statistical analysis. 

```{r}
rowDataNames(cptac)
```

The only ones that we will be needing below are the peptides sequences
and the protein identifiers. Below, we store these variables of
interest and filter them using the `selectRowData` function.

```{r}
rowvars <- c("Sequence", "Proteins", "Leading.razor.protein")
cptac <- selectRowData(cptac, rowvars)
rowDataNames(cptac)
```

## Managing missing values

Missing values can be very prominant in certain proteomics experiments
and need to be dealt with carefully. The first step is to assess their
presence accross samples and features. But before being able to do so,
we need to replace 0 by `NA`, given that MaxQuant encodes missing data
with a 0 using the `zeroIsNA` function.

```{r}
cptac <- zeroIsNA(cptac)
nNA(cptac)
```

The output of the `nNA` function tells us that 

- there are currently close to 50% is missing values in the data;
- there are 4051 peptides with 0 missing values, 989 with a single
  missing values, ... and 3014 peptides composed of only missing
  values;
- the range of missing values in the 6 samples is comparable and
  ranges between 4651 and 5470.

In this dataset, we have such a high number of peptides without any
data because the 6 samples are a subset of a larger dataset, and these
peptides happened to be absent in groups A and B.

## TODO

- log-transformation
- normalisation
- aggregation
